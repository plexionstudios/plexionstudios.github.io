		<p>The Community Centre has bots for different tasks. <a href="index.html">My own bot</a> and <a href="https://mee6.xyz">MEE6</a> moderate the server.</p>
		<p>head was, "how about i teach people how to draw a sword!". I still question what this is actually teaching people</p>
		<p>to this day. I ended up editing the video and re-releasing it for Plexmas.</p>

		<h2>200 VIEWS</h2>
		<p>In April 2019, I published a video called 'PewDiePie Congratulations - 8 Bit Mix' featuring a mix of an 8-bit</p>
		<p>congratulations remix and the official vocals. The video became my 2nd most viewed video hitting 288 views total!</p>
		<p>It stayed like this for quite a while.</p>

		<h2>Plexmas 2019</h2>
		<p>Walking to school one day I came up with this idea, "How about I make a special series for Christmas this year, it won't</p>
		<p>be that bad". I then created it and ran it from the 13th of December to, what was going to be the 25th but was eventually</p>
		<p>cancelled on the 17th. That doesn't mean it won't happen this year. Ehehe~ ;)</p>

		<h2>A New Beginning</h2>
		<p>On Christmas, I got a new gaming pc custom-built for me. It allowed the videos to be way more smooth and just</p>
		<p>a much better experience to watch and enjoy. You can view the parts in the computer by watching the first video</p>
		<p>in the playlist.</p>

		<h2>The Key to Success</h2>
		<p>After school on a Friday, I recorded a video on a new game made by a YouTuber I watch, DaniDev! I downloaded the game and</p>
		<p>played it while recording. I edited it and uploaded it, not expecting much attention on the video. The day after, I wake up</p>
		<p>to have a notification feed flooded with subscriber and comment notifications. It was surreal to see and I thank you all so much!</p>

		<h2>Present Day</h2>
		<p>I appreciate everyone who watches my videos and subscribes, it means so much! Now I create a range of videos on</p>
		<p>different games and topics. If you have any suggestions or feedback you can email me at plexionnet@gmail.com and talk</p>
		<p>to me; i may not respond instantly.</p>
