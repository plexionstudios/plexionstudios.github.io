# plexionstudios.github.io
Another source where my website is hosted - generally more up-to-date. Find the normal page here: [plexion.online](http://plexion.online)

## How is it made?
I have self-taught myself HTML & CSS and have eventually created this website. You can find some of my older attempts at [plexion.online/versions](http://plexion.online/versions/)

## What is it's use?
This is mainly just an experiment for me and helped me learn HTML & CSS. The main focus of the page itself is centered around my social medias & my past projects.
