# plexion.dev
The main website for my channel, [plexion](https://youtube.com/plexion) where you'll find projects i've been working on. 

## How is it made?
I have self-taught myself HTML & CSS and have eventually created this website. You can find some of my older attempts at [archives.plexion.dev](https://plexion.dev/versions/)

## What is it for?
This is mainly just an experiment for me and helped me learn HTML & CSS. The main focus of the page itself is centered around my social medias & my past projects.
