# Content Guidelines

Hello and welcome to the official Content Guidelines/Terms and Conditions document for all my content. This applies to all my channels on every platform, including the **plexion** YouTube channel, the **plexionGOLD** and **plexionVODS** YouTube channel and the **plexionLIVE** Twitch channel (and the rest that I cannot be bothered to include)

## Overview

My content is centered heavily around Minecraft, a game I didn't make - so I can't take any credit for that.

By watching my videos, you agree to:

* Not be hateful or disrespectful to me, or especially anyone featured
* Not leak or 'dox' people's private information that may be used for malicious purposes (address, names etc.)
* Not send out unjustified copyright strikes regarding content i've made, if you have a concern **email me [plexionbusiness@gmail.com](mailto:plexionbusiness@gmail.com)**
* Not over or just sexualise any of my content, write sexual comments or feedback, or draw/animate/create any sexual - in the slightest - content featuring me or anyone I know or feature in any of my videos, everyone in my content is under 18 and it's still **very** weird, especially if I have outright said **no.**

## Events + Datapack Usage

In many videos of mine, especially in 2021, I have been producing what I refer to as **'Minecraft Events'** videos. These are custom-made datapacks, either made by me or one of the people participating and are freely available for you to use and play with you and your friends.

By using event datapacks, you agree to:

* Give credit, either by a YouTube description mention (Datapack created by [plexion](https://youtube.com/plexion)), a name drop in the first 60 seconds of your video, or any other methods (email me)
* Take down the video or content in question if I request with a fair and justified reason (I don't plan on ever doing this)
* Not take ownership or credit of the source datapack, whether it be distributing or uploading to a sharing site as your own - this **includes editing parts of the datapack and leaving out original credit**

The same applies for any resourcepacks (texture, sound etc. pack changes), maps/map-packs made by me, or in a group channel (eg. Grand Scheme of Things)

## Clipping/Clips of Content

I have very similar rules for clipping content as many other content creators. In case you aren't aware, by "clipping content" or "clips" i'm referring to (usually) short (around 60 seconds, like YouTube Shorts) snippets/clips from any of my content that are uploaded on your own channel. No matter the reason, there are some rules that follow with this. By clipping, you agree to:

* Not clip **any** content from my YouTube videos, (whether it be plexion, plexionGOLD etc.)
* HOWEVER, you may clip content from either plexionVODS (on YouTube) or plexionLIVE (on Twitch) if the content you are clipping is not originally sourced from a YouTube video (you can't clip a reaction to one of my youtube videos n stuff). If you have any questions, email me about this kinda thing.
* Keep clips PG (family-friendly) and not sexualise any clips, everyone in my videos is under 18 and it's still weird

## Re-uploads/Translations

Translating content is very big in countries that don't have a primary language of English. Some folks with a great vision/goal in their mind have been translating content from many content creators like MrBeast, SwankyBox, AntVenom and more, using the original footage or re-creating in a similar or exact way with an overlayed translation voice layer. My stance on this is very firm, here it is:

* You are **not** allowed, under any circumstances, to **re-upload and/or translate my content** in any form involving video/images (loopholes are dumb you get what I mean)
* HOWEVER, if you still want to translate content but not re-upload my videos, you have the option to write a transcript of my content in a different language, this can then be added as an additional captions option on the source video itself and allows the video to be more accessible without unfair re-uploads etc., if you want to or have got a transcript ready, send me a business email and i'll add it to the video (and give credit in the description/comments)

## Conclusion

I think these rules are fair for both parties and should help let you know what you can and can-not do with my content. If you have any questions or inquiries then you can email me either through [plexionbusiness@gmail.com](mailto:plexionbusiness@gmail.com) or [plexionfans@gmail.com](mailto:plexionfans@gmail.com), depending on what it is.

By the way, don't try and find loopholes and abuse them in here, it's unfair and just unnecessary to deal with. That's all for now though, thanks for reading till the end I guess LMAO.
