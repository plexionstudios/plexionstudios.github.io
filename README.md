# plexion.dev
plexion.dev allows you to browse through a library of minecraft event datapacks and lets you choose one that interests you.

## What can it do?

The website offers a full [library](https://plexion.dev/library) of minecraft datapacks, resourcepacks and maps that are commonly used in my videos. With the individual projects having their own pages with information on file sizes, last updated + first release dates, compatiability, feature lists, screenshots and more. Pages are generally updated and kept in-sync with my [PlanetMinecraft page](https://planetminecraft.com/member/plexiondev/) on a regular basis - in the event they're not, it's either in the process of updating or I haven't realised (drop an issue if so)

## Why does this exist?

This was mainly made to learn HTML and CSS by myself. Like I alluded to, I've basically self-taught myself these two languages from scratch and now just work on my website n stuff. You can check out my older attempts over at [plexion.dev/versions](https://plexion.dev/versions) where I've archived **a lot** of builds from my website. If you have any questions, email me or drop an issue!
